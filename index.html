							<p>When you think of creative + real estate investing, you probably think of beautiful remodels. I love a good remodel, and even more a good flip that makes money and improves the space for an end buyer.  But remodeling is just scratching the surface of the creativity needed to be successful in real estate investing. How you present an offer and structure a deal is often the difference between success and failure.  You must know <a href="https://inlpcenter.org/what-is-neuro-linguistic-programming-nlp/" target="_blank">how to talk to sellers</a>.  Specifically, what to say on marketing messages to get sellers calling you. And in turn, what to say when you talk to them so you can schedule appointments and lock up deals.</p>

				<h2>About Shiela</h2>

			<div class="container">
				<div class="background-content">
					<p>I got into REI from feeling like I had no one or nothing to count on.  I was looking for safety, stability and financial security.  I'm a survivor of severe early childhood trauma. While all of us have our traumas, I was born into domestic violence and mental illness.  At 2 yrs old I was taken from my biological parents by court order.  The neglect and chaos in my own childhood home drove me to ensure I had security, safety and stability for myself and my children.  In addition to investing in real estate for our financial health, my husband and I cultivate our mental and relational health too.  We both work from home.  My husband and I have a weekly lunch date. And we make sure one of us is there to meet our children when they come home from school.</p>
					<p>We greatly value our physical health. We have created a lifestyle where we exercise regularly. We enjoy Pilates and walking together. I practice yoga daily. I <a href="http://www.dancetobefree.org/" target="_blank">dance</a>. And he plays and coaches hockey. Maybe you can relate to wanting complete health for your body, mind, spirit and bank account?  Do you feel health in all aspects of your life is the ultimate in success?</p>
					<p>I learned everything I could about creating long term wealth and multiple streams of income.  I paid a mentor who taught me about creative financing aka buying on terms ("no money down") - Wholesaling, L/Os, Sub to, Owner Financing. Followed his guidance. Became financially independent by 30.</p>
					<p>Together, with my husband, we achieved our goal of buying in Boulder City. I saw the opportunity that the Boulder market offers.  I was right!  Because we bought in Boulder we have 35-50% more equity in our portfolio than we would have if we bought in the surrounding markets.  The financial independence and overall health we have is due to our success in real estate investing.</p>
					<p>I am a warrior.  And if you are landing on my site, YOU are a warrior too.</p>
